	<text>The Sixteenth Amendment
The Constitution of the Unit
ed StAtfls was mimnsplv maAo Aif
icultj to amend. Madison, the
'Father of the Constitution,' was
against ''innovation' and Hamil-'
ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'
ging people. So the Constitution'
was made unchangeable except b.
a vote of two-thirds of Congress,
and three-fourths of the State
Legislatures or State Conventions.
One-forty-fourth df the voters to- j
day, if prperly placoed, can block'
any amendment. Of the four,
hundred and thirty-five amend-'
wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'
noi one was aaopteu. it is tne
belief of many people that the;
Constitution can never be amend-'
ed. I
"We, on 'the other hand, believe
Amendment permiting the income1
tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'
cle. The- resolution was. -unani-j
mously adopted by the Senate,
and. almost unanimously by the
House. Thirty-five of the forty
six States must ratify, but thirty-five
States will be found. The
South is for it; the west is for
it; the real people of the East
are for it; the two parties have
declared in. its favor and Presi
dent Taft has taken his stand on
it. It is more than the mere
question of an income tax, al
though that is important. It is a
question of national sovereignty,
of the right of ninety millions of
petTple to tax. themselves as they
deem just and expedient. It is
an issue upon which in times of
danger the national welfare, ev
en the national existence, might
depend. The Sixteenth Amend
ment nnist and will be adopted.
But it will not be adopted by
the people staying at. home and
wishing for it. It must be made
an issue in every 'State, in every
assembly district. Time fights
on the side of the Sixteenth
Amendment; there is no limit.
Once a State adopts it, the rati
fication lasts' forever. But if
the ratification is not made the
first session, H may be again pro-,
posed for 'the second, third,
tenth, or ninety-ninth time. If iwe
do not suceed at first,, we can
j try, try again.
I The Sixteenth Amendment
must be ratfiied, not only to en
able pur Government in times of
peace and war to impose equita-.
ble taxes, but also to place the
fundamental law of the land,
where it should be placed in the
hands of an intelligent, tolerant,
and liberty-loving, people.</text>

	<text>Sixteenth Amendment.
Washington. Feb. 3.—The provi
sion authorizing an income tax as now
i?nnen.?nP£rtknown
.of
the federal
constitu­
tion will be as the "Sixteenth
Amendment" and reads as follows:
Article XVI.—The congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes on
incomes, from whatever source de-
w'",ou'
apportionment among
the states, and without regard to any
census or enumeration."
The change in the fundamental la'V
or the land marks a new epoch in the
American tax system. For the first,
time congress is given specific authori
ty by a provision of the federal con
stitution to levy an income tax. All
previous efforts for a tax of this kind
have been without the explicit author
ity of a constitutional provision. Tho
change also marks a broad develop
ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs
torn of the a basis for taxation, simi
lar to the systems now in force in
Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland,
Spain and various other countries.
New Source of Revenue.
Probably the most important aspect
of an income tax. as now authorized
by the constitution, is that it adds a
new source of revenue for the govern
ment. At present the two great
sources of government revenue aro
customs duties levied by tariff acts on
goods imported from foreign coun
tries and internal revenue taxes on
tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer
tain other articles. Each of these
sources at present produces a little
less than half of the total revenues
of the government. In 1911 the total
government revenues were $700,100,
906 and of this customs duties yielded
$11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'
taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re
mainder came from sales of public
lands, the corporation tax and various
miscellaneous sources. Under an in
come tax, however, a new and far
reaching source of revenue ls provid
ed for the government, and this will
in turn reduce the amounts required
rfom the other sources of revenue,'
customs and internal revenue, in or
der to meet the expenses of govern
ment. This last phase is likely to have
an important bearing on tariff legis
lation as hereafter enacted.
Before the amendment formally be
comes a part of the constitution to.
day's action of the legislature must be
transmitted to the secretary of state
at Washington and proclamation of
the ratification made.
First Step In 1909.
The first official step toward amend
ing the constitution so as to authorise
specifically an income tax was taken
by the senate on July 7. 1909. By
unanimous vote, that body adopted a
resolution, submitting this amend
ment to the legislatures of the respec
tive states. Only a few days later, on
July 12, the house passed the resolu
tion by a vote of 317 to 14.</text>

	<text>Here is the
Sixteenth Amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States, rati
fied Monday:
"Article XVI. The Congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes
on incomes, from whatever source
derived, with ou t apportionment
among the several States, and with
out regard to any census or enumer

ing the amendment effective. With

that the Wyoming Legislature had

was received by Senator RichardHon,
of Delaware, Btating that his State

thirty-six were needed.

of the Finance Committee, spoke
for the Senate. Representative Hull,

of the Ways and Means Committee.
spoke for the House.
Senator Norris Brown, of Nebras
ka, Republican, author of the
amendment, which he introduced in
the Senate on June 17, 1909, with
pardonable pride, announced to the
Senate during the afternoon that
three-fourths of the sovereign States
had ratified it. He congratulated
the Senate and the country on the
result. The amendment will not be
come actually a part of the Constitu
tion until the notice of the ratifi

approximately $100,000,000 a year
by the new tax and to graduate it
so that persons of great wealth will
pay at a higher rate.</text>

	<text>The Sixteenth Amendment.
The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
out regard to any census or enumeration."
Congress having been given this power what is its duty We
believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress that the
amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
arise.
As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good We
think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
of the people.
The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
ing it up that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
the rich, where we believe it belongs.
But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
one.
It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
from others that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay</text>

	<text>INCOME TAX LAW
AGAIN ATTACKED.
Washington, Sept. 23. Counsel
for Union Pacific Railroad stock
holders and others have filed a brief
in the Supreme Court attacking as
unconstitutional the income tax
provisions of the Underwood-Simmons
tariff law.
The attorneys contend that while
the sixteenth amendment empowers
congress to impose a tax on "incomes
from whatever source derived," the
framers of the law stretched it to
cover many taxes other than on in
come. It is asserted, too, that there is no
constitutional authority for taxing a
specific class of persons, unmarried
men, more than others, or for the
super-tax imposed upon men with
incomes over $20,000.</text>

Washington, D. C., Oct. 13.—An an

      <text>Are Casual Profits Income?
The discussion of this proposition
revolves around the Sixteenth Amend
ment of the Constitution and the le
lation passed by the Congress a
gis
fter
the ratification of the Amendment
The Sixteenth Amendment to the
Constitution provides: "The Congress
shall have power to lay and collect
taxes on incomes, from whatever
Source derived, without apportionment
.among the several states, and with-,
out regard to any census or enumera
tion."
The statute specifically imposes &
tax upon net income which "shall in
clude gains, profits, and income de
rived from sales or dealing in proper
ty," and then provides: "(c) For the
purpose of ascertaining the gain de
rived from the sale or other disposi
tion of property, real, personal, or
mixed, acquired before March 1, 1913,
"the fair market price or value of such
•property as of March 1, 1913, shall
be the basis for determining the am
ount of such gain derived."
It is the contention of the plaintiff
that the statute is unconstitutional
-an so far as it taxes as income the
increased value of investments.when
J-ealized by sale, and that such a tax
is a direct tax upon capital or property
not authorized by the Sixteenth
Amendment and not a tax upon in
come. In other words, that such gains
do not come within the definition of
Income as the word is used in the Six
teenth Amendment.
On the other hand, it is the conten
tion of the Government that sueh
gains do constitute income properly
taxable under the Income Tax Law of
1916.
We are therefore brought to a con
sideration of the scope of the Six
teenth Amendment, because there is no
question but that prior to the adop
tion of this Amendment the Congress
had no power to tax as income gains
arising^ from the sale of property
where the owner thereof was not a
dealer or trader in such property so
as to justify an excise tax upon his
business.</text>

Women Have
Right to Vote
Tennessee's Ratification
Gives 9,500,000 More
Right to Vote for Next
President in the Fall
Fight Begun in 1848
Campaign Opened in Seneca
Falls Started Movement
Which Enveloped World
Woman suffrage was won for the
women of all the states in the Union
when Tennessee, th'e thirty-sixth state,
ratified the Federal amendment. Ap?
proximately 27,000,000 women will be
entitled to vote in the Presidential
election this fall. State suffrage al?
ready ha^l enfranchised 17.500,000, and
ratification adds to this number 9,500,
000.
Thii marks the end of the women's
campaign for the ballot which began
obscurely in a little meeting in Seneca
Falls, N. Y., in 1848, swept across this
country, and extendea the political
freedom of women to nearly every
other nation in the civilized world.
Fifteen states in the United States
already had conferred full franchise
rights on women, and in fifteen others
women were entitled to vote for Presi?
dent and for certain municipal offices,
but not for members of Congress.
The suffrage amendment resolution
was passed by the Congress on June 4,
19li). Its wording was that of the orig?
inal Susan B. Anthony amendments,
drawn up by the pioneer suffragist soon
after the Civil War had enfranchised
the colored people and following the
form of the Fifteenth Amendment. It
reads:
"The right of citizens of the United
States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any state' on account of sex.
"Congress shall have power by ap?
propriate legislation to enforce the
provisions of this article."
Dates of Ratification
Thirty-six states ratified the woman
suffrage amendment in the following
order:

Special Sessions Called
The fact that many state legislatures
did not hold regular sessions in 1920,
and would be required to call special
sessions if the .suffrage amendment
were to become effective in time f?ir
the Presidential elections, was the last
great obstacle the suffrage movement
had to overcome. Even in states
where the women had voted for I
many years and where ratification was
more or less an accepted fact the Gov?
ernors hesitated to call special ses-

Colby when word of the vote at Nash?
ville reached the State Department. He
was prepared, Mr. Colby said, to issue

ly on receipt of official notice that
Tennessee had ratified the amendment.
j When the word of ratification came
officials of the National Woman's party
at once sought assurances from Secre?

resentatives in Nashville to see that no
time was lost in forwarding the official
notice to the State Department.
The woman's party also announced
that steps toward a national celebra-1
tion at the cankar liad been taken. The'
date will be fixed later, and included in
the ceremonies will be the presentation

      <text>TITANIC, THE TITON OF THE OCEAN, 3
FINDS WATERY GRAVE ON FIRST TRIP.
OVER 1,400 PEOPLE ARE DROWNED
WHITE STAR LINER STRIKES AN ICEBERG, WHILE
GOING AT FULL SPEED AT 1:25 MONDAY
MORNING AND GOES DOWN IN
LESS THAN AN HOUR.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE SAVED
But Many Wealthy and Prominent M en Are Lost.The White
Star liner Titanic, the world's great
est steamship has gono down some 500
miles off Cape Race, with 630 of her
1,300 passengers and her full crew of
860 men on board. That the greatest
catastrophe in marine history has oc
curred to a vessel of their line is ad
mitted by the oflicials of the White
Star Steamship company In New York
The liner Carpathia, the first vessel to
come within sight of the Titanic, res
cued all the Titanic's life boats in
which were 670 persons most of them

women and children. Many women
and children, however, have perished.
When the Carpathia reached the ill
fated vessel no sign of life was to ho
seen anywhere, the mountainous ocean
swells giving much evidence to the
stupendous disaster. Early reports
stated that all the passengers and the
crew of the Titanic had been taken
off by the Allen liner's Virginian and
the Parisian, and the Carpathia, but
wireless message received here dis
credit these reports in every detail
No hope is held out at the offices or
the White Star line that, any man on
board has survived fo tell the story of
the final sinking of the levithian, al
though some of the women in the
boats may have witnessed the sinking.
Only by miracle, it is pointed out,
could any person who stood by the
ship escape the great vessel's power
ful suction as she sank to the bottom.
The Titanic carried the most notable
list of passengers ever borne across the
Atlantic by one vessel. Homecoming
American tourist postponed their sail
ing weeks ago so as to ride the new
wonder of the season on her maiden
voyage.
Dispatches state that the Titanic
went down at 2:20 o'clock Monday
morning. The delay in the transmis
sion of the news is attributed to the
fact that all dispatches have been sub
ject to difficult relays.
The collision of the Titanic with an
Iceberg is now known to have been
a lieadon crash that occurred while
the liner was proceeding little less

than her best speed. She was a day
ahead of her schedule and it is con
sidered probable that an attempt to
make a record-breaking voyage was
the hope of her crew when she entered
the ice field.
Her forward plates were completely
wrecked. A gaping wound opening
below her water line and letting the
water into her forward compartments.
In the meantime the lifeboats were
manned and into them were placed
as many of the women and chil
dren as they could hold. The
boats were put off while there was
yet some hope of saving the Titanic
afloat until wireless could summon
help. Later and more conservative es
timates tell of great bravery on the
part of the men passengers. There
was a minimum of disorder. John
Jacob Astor. who, with his bride, was
returning from their long honeymoon
abroad, saw his bride placed in a life
boat safely away. Col. Astor was
drowned. The work of getting the life
boats away, the work of allaying
the fears of the great crowd of pas
sengers as much as possible, the
work of keeping the pumps in opera
tion and the engines throbbing—these
tasks and countless others were direct
ed by Captain Smith, the vener
able commander of the Titanic, and
before her advent the commander of J
the Olympic who displayed almost su
perhuman power of mind and body at
the world's most horrible sea disaster, I

ice on the high seas.
A wireless message from the Vir- |
ginia states that the occupants of the
small boats which she picked up have •
been transferred to the Carpathia
which is proceeding to New York.
The Titanic struck the iceberg at
1:26 Sunday night and floundered at
2:20 Monday morning.
At daybreak the Carpathia arrived
on the scene and her passengers and
crew brought the small boats with
their precious human cargo into New
York.
The boats which rushed to the Ti
tanic's aid found only the scattered
life boats and a dismal scene of wreck

Official Statement.
White Star line had received no word
here at 8 o'clock other than from the
press dispatches of the reported acci
dent to the Titanic.
They were unable to understand
why thev had not received some dis-
f latches from the Titanic. The follow
ng statement was made by one of the
Officers:
"Twelve hours have passed since the
collision was reported to have taken
place and we have heard nothing of
the a- ident. It is most strange the
Titanic's sister ship, Olympic, which
has a wireless apparatus of sufficient
strength to send a message across the
Atlantic, has sent us nothing. The
Olvmpic left here last Saturday and
this morning is 360 miles away from
the Titanic. The Olympic should be
alongside the Titanic at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. The Olympic has been no
tified of the reported accident."
A wireless message from the Titanic
received shortly after midnight an
nounced the liner had struck an ice
berg off the banks of Newfoundland
and was in a sinking condition. Trans
fer of the passengers to the life boats
began at once. The accident occurred
at 10:25 o'clock last night. Two hours
later the ship's wireless apparatus,
which had been working so badly as
to permit of only intermittent and
fragmentary messages, failed com
pletely. The last words sent by the operatoi
told that the vessel was apparently
doomed, "sinking by the head" anl
that the women passengers were be
ing rushed into the lifeboats. A reas
curing feature was that the weather
was calm and clear, and help only a
few hours away.
First S. O, S. Message.
The Titanic's fii.st S. O. S. message
was received by he Allan liner Vir
ginian which, according to the posi
tion given by thi Titamic's operator
was not more than 170 miles away. The
captain of the Vi-inlan at once start-
ed his boat at full speed for the scene
of the disaster announcing to his broth
er officer on the bridge of the Titanic
that the Virginian should reach him
by 10 o'clock this morning. The Titan
Ic's accident happened in latitude 41 -4d
north, longitude 50 .14 west. This point
is about 1,150 miles due east of New
York city and 450 miles south of Cape
Race. Newfoundland, wireless station.
All the messages from the ship were
relayed to the Cape Race wireless sta
tion by the Virginia and forwarded
by the Marconi company to New York
city. The Titanic's twin ship, Olympic,
which left New York last week, wa3
also in direct communication with tne
sinking boat from a point 300 miles
away and started at once for the scene.
The Titanic, which is on her maiden
trip is in charge of Captain Smith,
who was on the bridge of the big
Olympic when that boat collided with
the British cruiser Hawke last Sep
tember. The Titanic carries 1,470 pas
sengers, of whom 318 are in the first
cabin and 262 in the second cabin.

The passenger list is a notable one
including Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob
Astor; Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt;

Steamship men here today character
ized the disaster as "the most start
ling news which has come in from the
s-ea since the advent of wireless teleg
raphy." The firet heard of the accident was
about 1 o'clock this morning when 8
bulletin from Montreal stated that the
Allan line offices there had received a
wireless from Captain Gambell of the
steamer Virginian, stating that the
Titanic was calling for assistance af
ter a. collision with -as iceberg. The
Virginian's captain addeu he was head
ing his boat for the Titanic, whose
position was said to be about 350 miles
south of Cape Race, Newfoundland.

1,470 passengers
and a crew of 860 men. A large per
centage, if not the majority of the
passengers are Americans. The news
paper offices were besieged early to-
i day bv inquiries from hundreds of
persons shocked by the fragmentary
newspaper dispatches seen at the
breakfast table but in the early morn
ing hours there was nothing vital to
add to the alarming reports from
Cape Race. Something further was
expected every moment, but there was
nothing at hand to relieve the anxiety
fhown in every quarter. Vice Presi
dent P. A. S. Franklin of the Interna
tional Merchant Marine, the highest
official of the White Star line here,
was one of the first to be notified of
the reported disaster but it was only
through the Associated Press that he
learned of it, and for hours there
after he could only experess his as
tonishment at the news and his doubt
that such a large and thoroughly pro
tected ship as the Titanic could be in
danger at sea.
l-rpon hearing the first reports he
spoke reassuringly, saying that only
eight or ten hours before the White
Star offices had received a wireless giv
ing the liner's position. He was sure if
she had met with any accident he
would have heard from her promptly.
"We are absolutely satisfied even if
she was in collision with an iceberg
she Is in no danger," he said.</text>
