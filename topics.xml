	<text>The Sixteenth Amendment
The Constitution of the Unit
ed StAtfls was mimnsplv maAo Aif
icultj to amend. Madison, the
'Father of the Constitution,' was
against ''innovation' and Hamil-'
ton' feared the turbulent, chan-'
ging people. So the Constitution'
was made unchangeable except b.
a vote of two-thirds of Congress,
and three-fourths of the State
Legislatures or State Conventions.
One-forty-fourth df the voters to- j
day, if prperly placoed, can block'
any amendment. Of the four,
hundred and thirty-five amend-'
wents proposed from 1889 to 1904'
noi one was aaopteu. it is tne
belief of many people that the;
Constitution can never be amend-'
ed. I
"We, on 'the other hand, believe
Amendment permiting the income1
tax, is possible, probable, inevita-'
cle. The- resolution was. -unani-j
mously adopted by the Senate,
and. almost unanimously by the
House. Thirty-five of the forty
six States must ratify, but thirty-five
States will be found. The
South is for it; the west is for
it; the real people of the East
are for it; the two parties have
declared in. its favor and Presi
dent Taft has taken his stand on
it. It is more than the mere
question of an income tax, al
though that is important. It is a
question of national sovereignty,
of the right of ninety millions of
petTple to tax. themselves as they
deem just and expedient. It is
an issue upon which in times of
danger the national welfare, ev
en the national existence, might
depend. The Sixteenth Amend
ment nnist and will be adopted.
But it will not be adopted by
the people staying at. home and
wishing for it. It must be made
an issue in every 'State, in every
assembly district. Time fights
on the side of the Sixteenth
Amendment; there is no limit.
Once a State adopts it, the rati
fication lasts' forever. But if
the ratification is not made the
first session, H may be again pro-,
posed for 'the second, third,
tenth, or ninety-ninth time. If iwe
do not suceed at first,, we can
j try, try again.
I The Sixteenth Amendment
must be ratfiied, not only to en
able pur Government in times of
peace and war to impose equita-.
ble taxes, but also to place the
fundamental law of the land,
where it should be placed in the
hands of an intelligent, tolerant,
and liberty-loving, people.</text>

	<text>Sixteenth Amendment.
Washington. Feb. 3.—The provi
sion authorizing an income tax as now
i?nnen.?nP£rtknown
.of
the federal
constitu­
tion will be as the "Sixteenth
Amendment" and reads as follows:
Article XVI.—The congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes on
incomes, from whatever source de-
w'",ou'
apportionment among
the states, and without regard to any
census or enumeration."
The change in the fundamental la'V
or the land marks a new epoch in the
American tax system. For the first,
time congress is given specific authori
ty by a provision of the federal con
stitution to levy an income tax. All
previous efforts for a tax of this kind
have been without the explicit author
ity of a constitutional provision. Tho
change also marks a broad develop
ment of the economic and fiscal s.vs
torn of the a basis for taxation, simi
lar to the systems now in force in
Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland,
Spain and various other countries.
New Source of Revenue.
Probably the most important aspect
of an income tax. as now authorized
by the constitution, is that it adds a
new source of revenue for the govern
ment. At present the two great
sources of government revenue aro
customs duties levied by tariff acts on
goods imported from foreign coun
tries and internal revenue taxes on
tobacco, spirits, olemargarlne and cer
tain other articles. Each of these
sources at present produces a little
less than half of the total revenues
of the government. In 1911 the total
government revenues were $700,100,
906 and of this customs duties yielded
$11.3,846,269, while internal revenue'
taxes yielded $331,759,375. The re
mainder came from sales of public
lands, the corporation tax and various
miscellaneous sources. Under an in
come tax, however, a new and far
reaching source of revenue ls provid
ed for the government, and this will
in turn reduce the amounts required
rfom the other sources of revenue,'
customs and internal revenue, in or
der to meet the expenses of govern
ment. This last phase is likely to have
an important bearing on tariff legis
lation as hereafter enacted.
Before the amendment formally be
comes a part of the constitution to.
day's action of the legislature must be
transmitted to the secretary of state
at Washington and proclamation of
the ratification made.
First Step In 1909.
The first official step toward amend
ing the constitution so as to authorise
specifically an income tax was taken
by the senate on July 7. 1909. By
unanimous vote, that body adopted a
resolution, submitting this amend
ment to the legislatures of the respec
tive states. Only a few days later, on
July 12, the house passed the resolu
tion by a vote of 317 to 14.</text>

	<text>Here is the
Sixteenth Amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States, rati
fied Monday:
"Article XVI. The Congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes
on incomes, from whatever source
derived, with ou t apportionment
among the several States, and with
out regard to any census or enumer
a'ion." Wyoming had the honor of mak
ing the amendment effective. With
in two hours after word was received
that the Wyoming Legislature had
ratified the amendment, a telegram
was received by Senator RichardHon,
of Delaware, Btating that his State
had also ratified the amendment,
and to this was added New Mexico,
making thirty-eight States to act
favorably, Utah and New Jersey
are expected to do the same. Only
thirty-six were needed.
The Democrats tariff makers of
the House and Senate forthwith an
nounced that thby would begin pre
parations at once to enact an income
tax law a3 a part of the Democratic
tariff programme at the coming ex

Simmons, of North Carolina, who
will probably be the next chairman
of the Finance Committee, spoke
for the Senate. Representative Hull,
of Tennessee, the income tax expert
of the Ways and Means Committee.
spoke for the House.
Senator Norris Brown, of Nebras
ka, Republican, author of the
amendment, which he introduced in
the Senate on June 17, 1909, with
pardonable pride, announced to the
Senate during the afternoon that
three-fourths of the sovereign States
had ratified it. He congratulated
the Senate and the country on the
result. The amendment will not be
come actually a part of the Constitu
tion until the notice of the ratifi
cation by Wyoming or Delaware has
been formally filed with the Senator
of StatP, which will doubtless be
within a few days.
The Democrats propose to raise
approximately $100,000,000 a year
by the new tax and to graduate it
so that persons of great wealth will
pay at a higher rate.</text>

	<text>The Sixteenth Amendment.
The Sixteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United
States has been ratified by the legislatures of thirty eight states,
two more than the required three-fourths. It gives Congress the
power "to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
derived, without apportionment among the several states, and with
out regard to any census or enumeration."
Congress having been given this power what is its duty We
believe that it should at once proceed to pass an income tax law,
Some argue that no such duty devolves upon Congress that the
amendment simply gives congress the power to act but that it does
not follow that it should act at once as present conditions do not
demand such action and the provision is solely for the purpose of
giving congress the power to pass a law when the necessity shall
arise.
As viewed in the light of history, is this argument good We
think not. The Sixteenth Amendment is the only amendment to
the constitution in forty three years. In 1893 Congress passed an
income tax law which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional.
For this reason those favoring an income tax law proposed amend
ing the constitution. Finally in 1909 both houses of Congress by a
three-fourths vote passed the proposed amendment and now three
fourths of the states by their legislatures have ratified it.
Since a few years after the close of the Civil War, there has been
practically as much need for an income tax at one time as another.
The members of Congress believed that the people wanted this law
or- they never would have passed the amendment, as most of them
were voting to impose a tax upon their own incomes. The members
of the state legislatures that ratified it also thought that the people
wanted it or they would not have voted for it, because it is not the
type of measure that is passed by a legislature against the wishes
of the people.
The people believe that an income tax is fair and just and Con
gress should pass one at once. We can see no reason why one
should not be passed. It is only right that the people who are re
ceiving the largest benefits from government should pay for keep
ing it up that those who can best afford to pay for maintaining the
government should do so. A person's income is the best gauge of
his ability to pay. An income tax it is hoped and believed will take
some of the burden of the support and maintenance of the govern
ment off of the shoulders of the poor and put it on the shoulders of
the rich, where we believe it belongs.
But it's opponents says that it will make a nation of liars. If
a man will lie about his income to prevent paying a tax on it, he is
already lying about how much property he has to prevent paying a
tax on it. It is not making a liar out of him, because he was already
one.
It's opponents also say that it will be unjust, as incomes derived
from certain sources are much more definitely determined than
from others that the man on a salary will almost certainly pay</text>

	<text>INCOME TAX LAW
AGAIN ATTACKED.
Washington, Sept. 23. Counsel
for Union Pacific Railroad stock
holders and others have filed a brief
in the Supreme Court attacking as
unconstitutional the income tax
provisions of the Underwood-Simmons
tariff law.
The attorneys contend that while
the sixteenth amendment empowers
congress to impose a tax on "incomes
from whatever source derived," the
framers of the law stretched it to
cover many taxes other than on in
come. It is asserted, too, that there is no
constitutional authority for taxing a
specific class of persons, unmarried
men, more than others, or for the
super-tax imposed upon men with
incomes over $20,000.</text>

Washington, D. C., Oct. 13.—An an
nual revenue to the government of
$82,000,000 depends on the outcome of
arguments today before the supreme
court on the constitutionality of the
income tax. The first cases to reach

Woman suffrage was won for the
women of all the states in the Union
when Tennessee, th'e thirty-sixth state,
ratified the Federal amendment. Ap?
proximately 27,000,000 women will be
entitled to vote in the Presidential
election this fall. State suffrage al?
ready ha^l enfranchised 17.500,000, and
ratification adds to this number 9,500,
000.
Thii marks the end of the women's
campaign for the ballot which began
obscurely in a little meeting in Seneca
Falls, N. Y., in 1848, swept across this
country, and extendea the political
freedom of women to nearly every
other nation in the civilized world.
Fifteen states in the United States
already had conferred full franchise
rights on women, and in fifteen others
women were entitled to vote for Presi?
dent and for certain municipal offices,
but not for members of Congress.
The suffrage amendment resolution
was passed by the Congress on June 4,
19li). Its wording was that of the orig?
inal Susan B. Anthony amendments,
drawn up by the pioneer suffragist soon
after the Civil War had enfranchised
the colored people and following the
form of the Fifteenth Amendment. It
reads:
"The right of citizens of the United
States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any state' on account of sex.
"Congress shall have power by ap?
propriate legislation to enforce the
provisions of this article."

Special Sessions Called
The fact that many state legislatures
did not hold regular sessions in 1920,
and would be required to call special
sessions if the .suffrage amendment
were to become effective in time f?ir
the Presidential elections, was the last
great obstacle the suffrage movement
had to overcome. Even in states
where the women had voted for I
many years and where ratification was
more or less an accepted fact the Gov?
ernors hesitated to call special ses-
sions, for reasons of economy, or be?
cause of local political issues which
threatened to become embarrassing.

      Without doubt Harry Houdini, whose death, all too soon, is now to be
vecorded at the age of only fifty-two, was perhaps the most distinguished of
vabbis’ sons who chose the calling of entertaining the public.
Harry Houdini’s name was Eric Weiss and he was born in Appleton,
Wis., as the son of Rabbi Weiss. At the age of nine Eric joined a circus.
This was the beginning of a career which was to make the boy internation
ally famous. From performing on the trapeze, he aspired to more difficult
things and in course of time, whilst still in his teens, he was known as “the
Handcuff King” He could wriggle out of everything. No shackles, no mat
ter how strong, no matter how intricate, could hold him.
. From being “the Handcuff King,” he extended and elevated the range
of his performances. From 1885 to 1900 he played all over the country,
but he could not break into Broadway. New York’s Great White Way
would have none of him, Houdini was not made of the stuff that yielded.
If New York would not have him he would try his luck across the seas and
so to London he went. The experts of Scotland Yard, as the famous Eng
lish police department is known, handcuffed him. He made his escape, with
the result that he received a long engagement i the Alhambra, London’s
noted music hall. From the British capital his fame spread to the Con
tinent of Europe which he toured for six years. His return to his native
country was a triumph. He had no longer to beg of Broadway to give him
a hearing or to see fiim. The managers flocked to him.
From the year 1902 to the day of his untimely death, caused by his
refusal to break an engagement, Harry Houdini was the acknowledged mas
ter magician of the world. America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia ac
claimed him. By this time, 1908, he had dropped the handcuff tricks and
electrified his audiences by his more daring and more difficult tasks. There
were many who essayed to imitate him but they all failed miserably. Hou
dini could not be imitated. His fertile brain, his mechanical genius, his
startling discoveries made him unique. There was only one Houdini. And
so much was this recognized that the Standard Dictionary contains the word
“houdinize,” meaning “to release or extricate oneself (from confinemeut,
bonds, or the like) as by wriggling out” A man who gives a new word
to his native tongue must have to his credit a record of great and notable
achievements.
During the last few years Houdini enhanced his international fame
by exposing fraudulent mediums and all false claims in the field of spirit
uvalism. For nine consecutive times he was elected president of the Society
of American Magicians and he was also president of the Magicians’ Club
of London and a life member of the Authors’ Club of London, for Houdini
had written a number of books dealing with his art and with spiritualism.
He was also one of the organizers of the Rabbis’ Sons Association, an or
ganization composed of rabbis’ sons who had made their mark on the stage.
We have told in brief the life-story of Eric Weiss, or Harry Houdini,
by which name he will be remembered for all time, because it is an inter
esting speculation as to what extent his racial strain contributed to his
phenomenal success.

      Secrets of Houdini
Escape Artist Almost Defeated By Riveted Hot-Water Boiler
By Stuart 0. Hale
(North American Newspaper Alliance.)
PROVIDENCE, R. I„ Nov. 29.—
Bert Clark, Providence business
man, and Harry Houdini, the great
escape artist and magician, once
had a go at a Boston hot-water
boiler which almost proved a
match for the talented showman.
Houdini was at the height of his
success then, drawing $1,200 a
Last of Two Articles on Secrets of Harry
Houdini's Escapes.
Then I made two nuts which
looked exactly like rivet heads.”
Bert said they hid the special
bolts and fake rivets in the hollow
legs of the frame which supported
the cloth cabinet Houdini always
used to place around the thing
from which he was to escape.
Next the conspirators made a
tin pipe cutter and took it apart.
Houdini hid the parts about his
person.
“He was a master at that,” said
Bert. “He frequently carried a
whole bunch of keys on a ring
which searchers never found.
Plan Was Simple.
“We were ready. The night of
the performance I stood in the
wings with» Franz, Houdini's man.
They put him in the boiler—it
was on its side—and put the cap
on. Then the bolts were shoved
through and riveted tight."
The band began to play" as the
cabinet was placed around the
boiler.
“Houdini’s plan was simple. In
side the boiler he was to assemble
his little pipe cutter, cut the bolts
and knock them through, climb
out, insert the fake bolts and
screw on the rivets, tighten them,
hide the originals and the pipe
cutter and emerge.”
That was the plan, but time
passed and Houdini failed to ap
pear. The band played the musi
cal selection a second and then
a third time.
Bert said he was getting nervous
and Franz was showing the strain.
The audience sat frozen in their
seats, completely quiet.
Inside the boiler, perspiration
covered Houdini’s body as he
strained to push the cut bolts
through their holes. In the care
ful planning no thought had been
given to the tiny curled flange
of metal the pipe cutter turned
up on each side as it severed a
bolt. These little metal collars
jammed in the holes of the cover.
Took Cutter Apart.
About 15 minutes had passed
since the cover had been riveted
shut. Then Houdini tried one!
last thing. He took his pipe cut
ter apart and found that he was
able to insert one of the pieces
against the end of a bolt. Using
another piece as a hammer, he
tapped the bolts out, one by one.
“To my knowledge,” said Bert,
“no one ever discovered the fake
rivets, or, if they did, never knew
why they were there.”
In many cities Houdini visited,
he usually did one of his public
escapes to gain publicity for his
regular show. One of his stunts
here, which Bert knew all about j
but never discussed before, was to
be placed inside a burlap bag,
handcuffed with leg irons, and
thrown off the Crawford Street
Bridge.
Houdini never pretended he
possessed any supernatural ability
in performing his tricks and bit
terly attacked those who did.
Houdini quickly palmed it and
handed him the other watch he
was stymied.
Houdini, called by his fellow
artists “the Prince of Showmen,”
died on October 31, 1926, in De
troit. Eight days before, while in
Montreal, he allowed a group of
college students to visit him in his
dressing room.
ne of the visitors in the Mon
treal dressing room smashed his
fist against Houdini’s stomach.
Then, just as Houdini relaxed his
muscles, a second blow was struck.
Houdini never recovered.
